## Overview
The purpose of this repository is to analyze CityBike usage tends in New York City during August of 2019 in an effort to determine whether the service would be viable to implement in Des Moines Iowa. The data was obtained from the Citybike website, and then modified in Python to obtain additional features such as the duration of the trip. The updated information was then visualized in tableau to depict trip destination information as well as depictions of the user base.
